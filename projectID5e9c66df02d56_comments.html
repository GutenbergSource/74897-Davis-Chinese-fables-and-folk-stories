<HTML><BODY>A collection of Chinese Fables of Folk Stories, published in 1908. No particular difficulties, except that you will occasionally see a couple of Chinese characters in the titles of stories. You may simply mark them as [**Chinese: ####], with a hash-mark for each character. I will provide these during post-processing. 

<p>This very same book is also available at <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:Chinese_Fables_and_Folk_Stories.djvu">WikiSource</a>, and here most of the Chinese has already been provided, except for the word-list at the end of the book. If you feel like it, however, you can head over there as well, and add the Chinese, using various on-line tools, such as this <a href="https://www.qhanzi.com/">interface</a> where you can draw a character, and get matching characters in return. It works surprisingly good. (Unfortunately, you cannot paste these into the proofing interface, as we do not support Chinese characters here.)
